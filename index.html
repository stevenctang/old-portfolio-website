                Hello and thank you for taking the time to visit my site!
                My name is Steven Tang, and I am Computer Science student going into my last quarter of school.
                I will be a college graduate from Cal State University of San Bernardino with a B.S. Degree in Computer Science by December 2017.
                My areas of interest in the field include: <b>Full Stack Web Development</b>, <b>iOS Application Development</b>, and <b>Software Development.</b>
                As a student and a soon to be graduate, I am always looking to learn new things to expand my knowledge.

                        I worked with 2 other students to develop a number of applications that dealt with augmented reality. To 
                        develop mobile games that dealt with augmented reality, we used Unity. Along with Unity we used a plugin called
                        Vuforia to make it work. The application that we worked on the most throughout the quarter was a basketball game.
                        Once the user has a specific image in the camera's view, a hoop will appear where the user will be able to shoot
                        the ball in. The user is able to keep track of how many shots they have made.
